The [Arden Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arden_syntax) as a standardized language to represent medical knowledge can be used to express medical knowledge.
Arden2ByteCode is a newly developed open source compiler for the Arden Syntax. Arden2ByteCode runs on Java Virtual Machines (JVM) and translates Arden Syntax directly to Java bytecode (JBC) executable on JVMs. It also serves as runtime environment for execution of the compiled bytecode.

Arden2ByteCode was initially developed at the [Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/) in collaboration between the [Peter L. Reichertz Institute for Medical Informatics](https://plri.de/en/forschung/projekte/arden2bytecode) and the [Institute for Programming and Reactive Systems](https://www.ips.cs.tu-bs.de/).

Most programming work was done in 2010 by [Daniel Grunwald](https://github.com/dgrunwald).
