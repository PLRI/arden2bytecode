## Welcome to the Arden2ByteCode wiki!

This is the common place for documentation regarding the Arden2ByteCode compiler.

To start out, you might want to look at the following wiki pages:

* [Hello World! in Arden Syntax](hello-world!-in-arden-syntax.html)
* If you want to get Arden2ByteCode running, you may look at the [Getting started with Arden2ByteCode](getting-started-with-arden2bytecode.html) wiki page.
* If you want to compile Arden2ByteCode from source, have a look at the [Compiling Arden2ByteCode from source](compiling-arden2bytecode-from-source.html) wiki page.

For more pages, have a look at the GitHub [wiki pages index](https://github.com/PLRI/arden2bytecode/wiki/_pages) or the [list of wiki files](http://arden2bytecode.sourceforge.net/docs/) at our Sourceforge hosted website.
