To compile the parser in Eclipse:
	1. Create an external tool configuration:
		Location: javaw.exe (from your Java runtime)
		Working directory: ${container_loc}
		Arguments: -classpath ${project_loc}\tools\sablecc.jar org.sablecc.sablecc.SableCC ${resource_name}
	
	2. Select the file "arden.scc" and run SableCC.
	3. Right-click "src" and press Refresh so that Eclipse loads the generated files.
