 abstract = {Patient empowerment might be one key to reduce the pressure on health
	care systems challenged by the expected demographic changes. Knowledge
	based systems can, in combination with automated sensor measurements,
	improve the patients' ability to review their state of health and
	make informed decisions. The Arden Syntax as a standardized language
	to represent medical knowledge can be used to express the corresponding
	decision rules. In this paper we introduce Arden2ByteCode, a newly
	developed open source compiler for the Arden Syntax. Arden2ByteCode
	runs on Java Virtual Machines (JVM) and translates Arden Syntax directly
	to Java Bytecode (JBC) executable on JVMs. Arden2ByteCode easily
	integrates into service oriented architectures, like the Open Services
	Gateway Initiative (OSGi) platform. Apart from an evaluation of compilation
	performance and execution times, Arden2ByteCode was integrated into
	an existing knowledge supported exercise training system and recorded
	training sessions have been used to check the implementation.},
