Overview and how to download
----------------------------

I created a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) [repository of example MLMs](https://github.com/PLRI/example-mlms) in order to give you a starting point on how to write a Medical Logic Module (MLM).

It can be found at <https://github.com/PLRI/example-mlms>.

To download all the files, you can [download a zip file of the repository contents](https://github.com/PLRI/example-mlms/zipball/master) or use the `git` command as follows (provided that you have installed [Git](http://git-scm.com/)):

    $ git clone https://github.com/PLRI/example-mlms.git

Documentation
-------------

Documentation about how to invoke the MLMs is given in README.md files in the directories containing the respective MLMs.
