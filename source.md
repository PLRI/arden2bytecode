## History
The programming work was initiated in 2010 by [Daniel Grunwald](https://github.com/dgrunwald) as it can be seen on [GitHub](https://github.com/dgrunwald/arden2bytecode). He did the major work, namely the bytecode compiler and runtime environment itself.  
In 2010 [Hannes Flicka](https://github.com/hflicka) resumed work on the compiler and added a command line interface. He also created a basic [Eclipse plugin]({{ site.plugin.repo }}) and [a website]({{ site.homepage.repo }}), hosted on [Sourceforge](http://arden2bytecode.sourceforge.net/).  
In 2015 [Mike Klimek](https://github.com/Tetr4) resumed work on the eclipse plugin and compiler by adding new features and a test-suite. He gave the website an new look and ported it to [Github Pages]({{ site.homepage_new.repo }}).
