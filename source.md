### History

The programming work was initiated in 2010 by Daniel Grunwald as it can be seen on [GitHub](http://github.com/dgrunwald/arden2bytecode).  
Daniel did the major work, namely the bytecode compiler and runtime environment itself.  
In 2010, I forked the repository and added a command line interface. Still, work has to be done until Arden2ByteCode is production ready.
